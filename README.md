# üìä Wealth of Nations Analysis üåç

## Introduction ‚ÑπÔ∏è
This repository contains the code and resources for analyzing the Wealth of Nations dataset. The primary focus of this project is on cleaning, filtering, and visualizing key insights using Excel for data preprocessing and Tableau for visualization. The project also adheres to specific client requirements regarding accessibility, data protection, and prioritization of data.

## Data Processing üõ†Ô∏è
- **Cleaning**: The dataset underwent rigorous cleaning processes to rectify inconsistencies and ensure data accuracy.
- **Filtering**: Excel was utilized to filter the dataset, isolating relevant information for analysis.
- **Sorting**: Data sorting operations were conducted to prioritize information pertaining to the top 20 highest-ranking countries.

## Visualization üìà
Visualizations were crafted using Tableau, ensuring accessibility for color-blind individuals and focusing exclusively on the top 20 highest-ranking countries:
1. [Visualization 1]: [Brief description]
2. [Visualization 2]: [Brief description]
3. [Visualization 3]: [Brief description]
4. [Visualization 4]: [Brief description]

## Accessibility Considerations ‚ôø
- **Color Blindness**: Design elements and color choices were carefully selected to ensure accessibility for color-blind individuals.
- **Top 20 Focus**: All visuals exclusively highlight data related to the top 20 highest-ranking countries.

## Data Protection and Policy Adherence üîí
To adhere to data protection and computer misuse policies, the following measures were implemented:
The Data Protection Act 2018 controls how your personal information is used by organisations, businesses or the government.

The Data Protection Act 2018 is the UK‚Äôs implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Everyone responsible for using personal data has to follow strict rules called ‚Äòdata protection principles‚Äô. They must make sure the information is:

used fairly, lawfully and transparently
used for specified, explicit purposes
used in a way that is adequate, relevant and limited to only what is necessary
accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date
kept for no longer than is necessary
handled in a way that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unlawful or unauthorised processing, access, loss, destruction or damage

The Computer Misuse Act 1990 (CMA) is the main legislation that criminalises unauthorised access to computer systems and data, and the damaging or destroying of these.

## Conclusion üéâ
This project successfully delivers comprehensive insights derived from the Wealth of Nations dataset, emphasizing accessibility, adherence to client specifications, and compliance with data protection policies.
